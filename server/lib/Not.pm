=cut

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new()

Constructor of class.

Returns class instance.

It takes two paramters: location. Location is the path to the notification-folder of the AURORA-system.

No parameters are required. Location will be attempted read from the environment-variable AURORA_PATH and then combined with /notification to signify the path. If no environment parameter is found, location will be set to /local/app/aurora. In other words the location-parameters gives the path to the Aurora-installation.

=cut

=head2 send()

Attempts to send a notification.

Parameters to functions are: timestamp, type, about, from and message.

No parameters are required, but you should set type, about, from and message. Time will be set automatically at the time of adding it to a file.

See the Notification-class and specification for explanation of these field values.

Returns the Notification's ID upon success, 0 upon failure.

The error message upon failure can be read by calling the error()-method.

=cut

=head2 error()

Get the last error message from the Notification-instance.
