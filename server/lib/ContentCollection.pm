=head1 NAME

C<ContentCollection> - Class to hold a collection of Content-instances and manipulation of that collection.

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   my $content=Content::JSON->new();
   my $coll=ContentCollection->new(type=>$content);

   $coll->resetnext();
   while (my $c=$coll->next()) {
      my $hash=$c->decode();
   }

   $coll->size();
   $coll->type();

=cut

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A class to hold a collection of Content-instances of a given type (no mixing). The type is set upon instantiation. It has 
methods to iterate over the contents of the collection and add- or remove from it.

=cut

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new()

Constructor of ContentCollection-class.

Input is type-parameter that sets the Content-class type to use in the collection. The type parameter must be a Content-class.

Creates ContentCollection instance. If wrong or no type of content-instance is specified, an empty Content-class is created.

After Content-class type has been saved it is expected that all additions of Content-classes are of the same type. If one wants to change type one needs to call the reset()-method (see description).

Return value is the instance of ContentCollection.

=cut

=head1 METHODS

=head2 reset()

Resets the ContentCollection list of Content-instances.

No input is required, but if one wants one can add an instance of a Content-class. The ContentCollection will then expect all future classes that are added to be of this type.

If no Content-class is specified the reset()-method keeps the already set Content-class type.

Return value is 1 for success.

=cut

=head2 add()

Adds a Content-class instance to the ContentCollection list.

Return value is 1 upon success and 0 upon failure. Please check the error()-method to establish exact reason.

=cut

=head2 remove()

Removes a Content-class instance from the ContentCollection list.

A parameter that gives the Content-class instance is expected as input. If no input is given or wrong Content-class type it will result in failure.

Return valyes are 1 upon success and 0 upon failure. Please call the error()-method to establish the full reason.

=cut

=head2 type()

Returns the Content-class type that the ContentCollection consists of or expects to be used.

No input required.

=cut

=head2 resetnext()

Resets the next()-methods position counter, so that one can start giving out Content-class from the beginning of the list.

Return value is 1 for success.

=cut

=head2 next()

Retrives the next Content-class instance from the ContentCollection list.

Return the Content-class instance upon success and undef upon failure.

=cut

=head2 size()

No input needed. Returns the number of Content-class elements in the collection.

=cut

=head2 error()

Returns the last error message from the ContentCollection-class.

No input is required.
