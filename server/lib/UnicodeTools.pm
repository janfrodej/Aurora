=head1 NAME

C<UnicodeTools> - Module for handling unicode tasks

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use UnicodeTools;

   # convert string to A-Za-z letters where relevant
   my $str=map2az($str);
   # convert string to A-Za-z letter mathematically where relevant
   $str=map2azmath($str);

=cut

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A collection of functions to handle various unicode tasks.

=cut

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

This class does not have an instantiator/constructor. Methods are exporeted by default.

=cut

=head1 METHODS

=head2 map2az()

Converts string characters to their ASCII a-zA-Z equivalents by looking at the 
base unicode name.

Accepts these parameters in the following order:

=over

=item

B<str> The string to be mapped to a-zA-Z. SCALAR. Required.

=cut

=back

The method ignores characters that do not start with "LATIN [CAPITAL|SMALL LETTER] [A-Z]" and preserve them 
as they are in the string. The rest is converted to its a-zA-Z equivalent.

Returns the mapped/converted string.

=cut

=heda2 map2azmath()

Converts string characters to their ASCII a-zA-Z equivalents by applying a straight-forward 
mathematical algorithm.

Accepts these parameters in the following order:

=over

=item

B<str> The string to be mapped to a-zA-Z. SCALAR. Required.

=cut

=back

The method mathematically forces characters to be converted to the a-ZA-Z space in the ASCII-table. Characters that 
are already a-zA-Z are ignored. It is "unintelligent" in comparison to the map2az-method.

One option is to run map2az first and then run the map2azmath afterwards to pick up those characters that where not 
handled intelligently by the map2az-method, thus forcing all characters into the a-zA-Z space of the ASCII-table.

Returns the mapped/converted string.
