=head1 NAME

C<HTTPSClient::Aurora> - A HTTPS-client to connect to the AURORA REST-server.

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Is used in the same way as the HTTPSClient class. See HTTPSClient for more information.

Module makes it possible to execute any method-name on the HTTPS-server by taking the method-name you call and wrapping it as a servermethod-call through the
AUTOLOAD-mechanism.

   use HTTPSClient::Aurora;

   # after instantiation - see HTTPSClient documentation for that
   my %resp;
   my %parameters;
   $parameters{resourcetype}="whatever";
   if ($h->getServerResources (\%resp,%parameters)) {
      use Data::Dumper;
      print "RESULT: ".Dumper(\%resp);
   } else {
      print "ERROR: ".$h->error();
   }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A HTTPS-client to connect to the AURORA REST-server. It is basically a wrapper that inherits from the HTTPSClient-class and implements the AUTOLOAD 
mechanism in order to call any server-method that are called on it by using the lazydo()-method.
