# Mathematical manipulation of the error code
#
# CODE = NNNN x 100000 + SS x 1000 + TT x 10 + L
#
# Example:
#
# NNNN/ID = 1000, SS=13 (dataset), TT=51 (Client Input Issue), L=2
#
# CODE = 1000 x 100000 + 13 x 1000 + 51 x 10 + L = 100013512
#
# To reverse it / read it out:
#
# NNNN/ID = (CODE / 100000) % 10000
# SS = (CODE / 1000) % 100
# TT = (CODE / 10) % 100
# L = CODE % 10
