<h1 id="NAME">NAME</h1>

<p><code>StoreProcess::Fork</code> - Class for a StoreProcess that is run in a fork.</p>

<h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<p>This class is used in the same way as the StoreProcess-class. Please see the StoreProcess-class for more info.</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>Class for a StoreProcess that is run in a fork.</p>

<p>The class is used in the same way as the StoreProcess-class. Please seee the StoreProcess-class for more information.</p>

<h1 id="CONSTRUCTOR">CONSTRUCTOR</h1>

<h2 id="new">new()</h2>

<p>Instantiates the constructor of the class.</p>

<p>It is inherited from the StoreProcess-class and takes the same parameteres (see the StoreProcess-class for more information).</p>

<p>In addition it takes the parameter:</p>

<ul>

<li><p><b>funcptr</b> Reference to a function to run in the fork being executed. The parameters is required. If not specified it will run a no-do dummy process (see the mydonothing()-method).</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>Returns the StoreProcess-instance.</p>

<h1 id="METHODS">METHODS</h1>

<h2 id="execute_startprocess">execute_startprocess()</h2>

<p>Starts the fork&#39;ed process and runs the function specified as the funcptr-parameter to the new()-method.</p>

<p>This method is inherited from the StoreProcess-class. Please see the StoreProcess-class for more information.</p>

<p>The method is not to be called by the user and is for internal use.</p>

<h2 id="execute_cleanup">execute_cleanup()</h2>

<p>Cleans up after the fork&#39;ed process when it ends.</p>

<p>This method is inherited from the StoreProcess-class. Please see the StoreProcess-class for more information.</p>

<p>The method is for internal use and is not to be called by the user.</p>

<h2 id="execute_cease">execute_cease()</h2>

<p>Stops the fork&#39;ed function-process running.</p>

<p>This method is inherited from the StoreProcess-class. Please see the StoreProcess-class for more information.</p>

<p>The method is for internal use and is not to be called by the user.</p>

<h2 id="mydonothing">mydonothing()</h2>

<p>Does nothing. Placeholder for a function-reference.</p>

<p>Does nothing and directly writes the exitcode of the function before exiting itself. It is mean as a replacement for a missing funcptr-option in the new()-method (see the new()-method for more information).</p>

<p>Returns the exitcode of the function invoked (and are taken as the exitcode of the process). If successful return 0, if not &gt; 0.</p>

<p>The method is for internal use and is not to be called by the user.</p>
