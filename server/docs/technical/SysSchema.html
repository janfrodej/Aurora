<h1 id="NAME">NAME</h1>

<p><code>SysSchema</code> Module to check and clean values coming into the AURORA-system and defining metadata namespace.</p>

<h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<pre><code>use SysSchema;

# clean value
my $email=&quot;john.doe@somedomain.top&quot;;
$email=$SysSchema::CLEAN{email}-&gt;($email);

# get metadata namespace
my $usernamelocation=$SysSchema::MD{username};

# get constant
my $setcreated=$SysSchema::C{&quot;status.open&quot;};</code></pre>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>Module to check and clean values entered into the AURORA-system, but also to get namespace locations of specific metadata that are often used in some way.</p>

<p>This module is used everywhere in the AURORA-system when cleaning and checking of values are needed, so that the definition of it is in one place. The only exception is AuroraDB who has its own schema-module (Schema.pm).</p>

<p>It also contains a constant-section.</p>

<p>The various data-structures in order of appearance are:</p>

<ul>

<li><p><b>NTYP</b> HASH that defines notification types and their voting defaults.</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>C</b> HASH that defines Constants.</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>CLEAN</b> HASH that defines cleaning for various values used by the AURORA-system and their defaults.</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>MD</b> HASH that contains metadata namespace definitions of where often used information is located.</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>MDPUB</b> HASH that contains metadata namespace locations that are considered public metadata that can be handed out, even though it is located in the non-public part of the metadata (not starting with &quot;.&quot;).</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>CFG</b> HASH that defines where in the AURORA configuration file that various values are set.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these structures, the SysSchema-module also contains a definition of sources for various Notifications. Valid definitions are: $FROM_UNKNOWN, $FROM_REST, $FROM_MAINTENANCE, $FROM_NOTIFICATION, $FROM_LOG and $FROM_STORE.</p>

<p>Beyond this have a look in the SysSchema-module itself for more information about what is defined within the various structures themselves.</p>
