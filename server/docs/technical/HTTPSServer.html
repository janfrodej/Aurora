<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>Class to define and run a REST-server. It basically have methods to define an authentication handler and a database handler. These two should return information that is passed on to all methods in the REST-server defined through the addMethod()-method.</p>

<p>The Authentication-handler should return any ID or information that the methods of the server know to use to identify the credentials of the one calling the REST-method. For AURORA the handler returns either 0 for not authenticated or a number higher than 0 for a user ID from the AURORA database. All the methods in AURORA expects such a behaviour and can use that ID to identify who it is by talking to the database.</p>

<p>The database handler is meant to ensure that we have a valid database handler for the AURORA database that can be given to the method-function that handles the REST-method call. The database handler is expected to return this database instance (DBI-class type) or undef upon failure.</p>

<p>The loop-method of the HTTPSServer-class handles the waiting for connection and forking out of connections when a client connects. It also handles upgrading the HTTP-connection to a HTTPS or SSL-based connections. All connections to the server needs to be HTTPS-connections.</p>

<p>All calls to the HTTPSServer-class by clients are expected to be POST-type HTTP-data. It does not support different HTTP-method, such as GET, DELETE or what not. The type of HTTP-method being performed is instead defined by the method name itself, such as /getDatasetMetadata or /getName. This deviates from the typical REST-server implementation (where it is normal to use the HTTP-method to signify the verb of the resource being manipulated).</p>

<h1 id="CONSTRUCTOR">CONSTRUCTOR</h1>

<h2 id="new">new()</h2>

<p>Constructor. Creates class-instance.</p>

<p>Accepts the following input parameters:</p>

<ul>

<li><p><b>converter</b> Specifies a Content-instance reference that is used as the converter type for the data coming into the HTTPS-server. Optional. If not specified defaults to Content::JSON.</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>Listen</b> Queue size for listen. See IO::Socket::INET. Optional. Defaults to 5.</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>LocalPort</b> Local host port address. See IO::Socket::INET/IO::Socket::IP. Optional. Defaults to &quot;1000&quot;.</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>Log</b> Specifies a Log-instance reference (see AURORA Log-class). This is used to write events to the log if something happens and is also shared by all methods of the HTTPS-server. Optional. Creates a new Log-instance if none specified.</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>servername</b> Service name of the server that is reported as &quot;Server&quot; in the HTTP-response. Optional. If not specified will default to &quot;MyServerService&quot;.</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>settings</b> Specified a Settings-instance (see AURORA Settings-class). It basically brings the configuration settings of the HTTPS-server. This instance is shared by all methods of the HTTPS-server. Optional. Creates a new Settings-instance if none specified (or is invalid).</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>syslog</b> Specified a SystemLogger-instance (see AURORA SystemLogger-class). It gives a way to syslog when something happens for the HTTPS-server. Optional. Creates a new SystemLogger-instance if none specified or the reference is invalid.</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>SSL_ca_file</b> Specifies the CA for the key set (SSL_key_file and SSL_cert_file). Optional. Defaults to undef. See IO::Socket::SSL.</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>SSL_cert_file</b> Specifies the public SSL key of the HTTPS-server. Optional. Defaults to undef. See IO::Socket::SSL.</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>SSL_key_file</b> Specifies the servers private SSL key. Optional. Defaults to undef. See IO::Socket::SSL.</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>SSL_verify_mode</b> Sets how the certificate of the client is to be checked. Optional. Does not need to be changed and defaults to SSL_VERIFY_NONE (no need to verify the client in other words).</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>Timeout</b> Sets the HTTPS-server timeout of sockets. Optional. Defaults to 300.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides the parameters given, this method accepts any option from IO::Socket::SSL and/or IO::Socket::INET/IO::Socket::IP. Please note that from version 6.05 of HTTP::Daemon, it uses the IO::Socket::IP instead of IO::Socket::INET. This is preferred because the HTTP::Daemon then supports binding to both ipv4 and ipv6 addresses/interfaces.</p>

<p>By default this module enforces both ipv4 and ipv6 binding by setting the Family-parameter to AF_INET6. To bind to both ipv4 and ipv6 at the same time, only set the LocalPort-parameter and not the LocalAddr and/or LocalHost-parameters.</p>

<p>Returns an HTTPSServer-instance.</p>

<h1 id="METHODS">METHODS</h1>

<h2 id="bind">bind()</h2>

<p>Attempts to bind to the local address specified.</p>

<p>No input parameters accepted.</p>

<p>This method uses the parameters specified to new() and attempts to bind to the local interface specified. It will only bind by using a HTTP::Daemon-instance as per recommendation in the IO::Socket::SSL documentation. The connection will attempt upgrade to SSL as soon as the client has connected.</p>

<p>Returns 1 upon success, 0 upon failure. Please check the error()-method for more information upon failure.</p>

<h2 id="bound">bound()</h2>

<p>Returns if the instance is bound to the interface or not.</p>

<p>No input accepted.</p>

<p>Returns 1 if bound, 0 if not.</p>

<h2 id="addMethod">addMethod()</h2>

<p>Add a method to the HTTPS-server.</p>

<p>Accepts input in the following order: method-link, function-reference, comment.</p>

<p>The method-link is the absolute path from the server root of the REST-method being added. SCALAR. Required. In other words it is the link that the client needs to refer to in order to invoke that REST-method. Eg.: /getDatasetMetadata.</p>

<p>The function-reference is a reference to a Perl-function that does all the work of the REST-method. Required. Eg.: \&amp;MyFunctionReference.</p>

<p>Description is the explanation/comment to the REST-method. SCALAR. Required.</p>

<p>The methods added here are the methods available through the HTTPS-server.</p>

<p>Returns 1 upon success, 0 upon failure. Please check the error()-method for more information upon failure.</p>

<h2 id="removeMethod">removeMethod()</h2>

<p>Removes method from the REST-server.</p>

<p>Input is the method-link. See the addMethod() for information on formatting of it.</p>

<p>If the given method-link exists it is removed as a method for the REST-server.</p>

<p>Returns 1 upon success, 0 upon failure. Please check the error()-method for more information upon failure.</p>

<h2 id="setDBHandler">setDBHandler()</h2>

<p>Sets the function handling retrieving a functioning database instance.</p>

<p>Accepts input in the following order: function reference to the function handling connecting/ retrieving the database-instance.</p>

<p>The function handling the authentication process is expected to receive: message-instance (using Content-class of the HTTPSServer, eg. Content::JSON), database instance (same as returned from this method), Settings-instance and Log-instance.</p>

<p>It is up to the user of the HTTPSServer and its methods to define what is considered an acceptable database-instance in return. AURORA returns a connected instance of the AuroraDB-class (which are passed on to the REST-method function).</p>

<p>Returns a database instance upon success, undef upon failure. Please check the error()-method for more information upon failure.</p>

<h2 id="setAuthHandler">setAuthHandler()</h2>

<p>Sets the function handling the authentication of the REST-server.</p>

<p>Accepts one input: function reference to Perl function handling the authentication.</p>

<p>The function handling the authentication process is expected to receive: message-instance (using Content-class of the HTTPSServer, eg. Content::JSON), database instance (same as returned from the function set in setDBHandler), Settings-instance and Log-instance.</p>

<p>When authenticated the function is expected to return a user id or 0 upon failure.</p>

<p>Returns &gt; 0 on success, 0 upon failure. Please check the error()-method for more information upon failure.</p>

<h2 id="loop">loop()</h2>

<p>Main loop of the REST-server.</p>

<p>This method accepts no input.</p>

<p>This method is the main loop of the REST-server. It sits and waits for clients to connect and when a connection arrives, it forks out a separate process to handle it.</p>

<p>The separate process for the client-connection immdiately attempts to upgrade it to HTTPS/SSL. When such an upgrade has been successful it goes into a HTTP-request loop that will exists for this one client-call or if the KeepAlive-flag has been set it will loop until the client disconnects.</p>

<p>This loop handles running the database-handler and the authentication-handler. If database connection and authentication fails the REST-server informs the client and closes the connection and the loop.</p>

<p>If database connection and authentication were successful it invokes a REST-method function, if the REST-method exists, and passes these parameters to each function:</p>

<p>- message-instance (Content-class instance of the HTTPS-server) - Method-parameters as a HASH-reference (after being decoded from the data of the Content-class being used - typically JSON), Database instance (typically AuroraDB-instance) - User id from the Authentication-handler - Settings-instance - Log-instance - SystemLogger-instance.</p>

<p>The loop receives any potential feedback from the function performing the job of the REST-method and sends an answer to the client.</p>

<h2 id="message">message()</h2>

<p>Sends a message to the client.</p>

<p>Input accepted: Content-instance and HTTP code.</p>

<p>This method basically handles sending the response back to the calling client and with the HTTP code specified. It is called by the loop()-method and should not be called directly by the user of this HTTPSServer-class.</p>

<p>Returns 1 upon success, 0 upon failure. Please check the error()-method for more information upon failure.</p>

<h2 id="converter">converter()</h2>

<p>Get or set the Content-class being used for messaging between client and server.</p>

<p>If input is specified it is interpreted as a set and the input must be a valid Content-class.</p>

<p>Returns the Content-class upon success (also on set), undef upon failure. Please check the error()-method for more information upon failure.</p>

<h2 id="localaddr">localaddr()</h2>

<p>Get or set the local interface address and port of the REST-server.</p>

<p>If a set, it accepts one input &quot;addr&quot;. It must specify the address and port (if needed) of the REST-server.</p>

<p>Please note that changing/setting the local interface address does not have any effect on already bound HTTPSServer-instances.</p>

<p>Returns the address upon success (also on set), undef upon failure. Please check the error()-method for more information upon failure.</p>

<h2 id="port">port()</h2>

<p>Get or set the port number being used by the HTTPS-server.</p>

<p>If input is specified it is accepted to be a set and must be port number (SCALAR).</p>

<p>Returns the port-number (also on set).</p>

<h2 id="error">error()</h2>

<p>Get the last error of this class.</p>

<p>No input accepted.</p>

<p>Returns the last error message or a blank string.</p>
